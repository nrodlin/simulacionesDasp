Simulation generated.
To run in glaoSim/, use:
python glao.py params.py
To view the simulation configuration, use:
daspsetup.py glao.xml
To connect to a running simulation (to view PSFs, WFSs, DMs, etc in action) use:
daspctrl.py
or:
daspanalyse.py

Please edit params.py to alter the simulation to meet your requirements.

Some notes about this simulation:
It will first of all take an interaction matrix.
This will then be inverted to give a control matrix, using a simple SVD.
This least-squares wavefront reconstructor will then be used for AO correction.

The LGS tip-tilt signal is assumed valid, i.e. is used.  

Several improvements are possible (left as an excercise for the user):
Minimum variance wavefront reconstruction from the interaction matrix.
Ignore the LGS tip-tilt signal, in the user-generated control matrix.
Model-based reconstruction (e.g. FrIM, FEWHA, etc)

If you already have a control matrix, and thus do not need to generate one, you
can use --user=nopoke commandline option
